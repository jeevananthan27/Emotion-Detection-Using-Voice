<---------------------------------------------EMOTION DETECTION USING VOICE--------------------------------------------->


Emotion Detection Using Voice is one of my project in my college days and the 3rd year 
->I used to train the minimum amount of dataset that i have get through the Kaggle dataset website. By pushing the data i achieve 75% of accuracy .
->I used the Anaconda Navigator to present the project . If you like to take my project i suggest you to train many dataset and generate more accuracy.


About My Project:
Objective: 
The project aims to develop a system that can identify and classify human emotions based on vocal characteristics.

Key Components:

1.Data Collection: 
Gathering audio samples of individuals expressing different emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger).
2.Feature Extraction: 
Analyzing the audio signals to extract relevant features, such as pitch, tone, volume, and speech rate.
3.Machine Learning Models: 
Training algorithms (like SVM, neural networks) to recognize patterns in the extracted features corresponding to specific emotions.
4.Testing and Validation: 
Evaluating the model's performance using a separate dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability.
5.Applications: 
Potential uses include enhancing human-computer interaction, improving customer service, and aiding in mental health assessments.
